              The Naija Yellow Catalogue is an online business directory that
              contains the necessary information about businesses that are
              registered on the platform. The Naija Yellow Catalogue enables
              business owners to easily showcase their business and also aids
              the consumers to easily find useful information on required
              services. Naija Yellow Catalogue took shape after we carried out
              critical research on the increasing number of businesses
              especially the number of entrepreneurs over the years. Little
              businesses and start-ups have little or no online documentation.
              This makes it hard to find and patronize such businesses. Naija
              Yellow Catalogue has provided a scalable catalogue that solves the
              aforementioned issues , assures satisfaction and comfort, all at
              ease. We have also included an outstanding feature “EVENT TAB”
              which helps to search happening events around your location.

              several task and decided to join to solve the problem of
              insufficient documentation for businesses online. We have worked
              on various projects together over the years. We hope you have a
